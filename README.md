`cigpt` is an open-source utility developed in Go that retrieves error logs from CI pipelines and uses ChatGPT to perform an initial analysis and provide troubleshooting hints. The goal of this project is to assist all users in comprehending the errors in CI pipelines, which can be extremely complicated to read and understand.

This project is a fork of [k8sgpt](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt) and relies on a portion of its code base.
